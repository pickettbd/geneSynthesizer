INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

COMPILE
-------
Simply type `make'.  The program will be in the `bin' directory. If `python3'
doesn't invoke Python 3.5.1+ on your system, please change the `PYTHON3_BINARY'
variable near the top of the `Makefile' to the appropriate command (a full path
is also acceptable) before you type `make'.


INSTALL
-------
Type `make' followed by `make install'.  The binary will be in both the `bin'
and `/usr/local/bin' directories.  To change the installation location, change
the `PREFIX' variable near the top of `Makefile'.  


UNINSTALL
---------
Simply type `make clean'.  This will remove the binary in the `bin' directory.
If you installed with `make install', also type `make uninstall' to remove the
binary at the path provided by the `PREFIX' variable in the `Makefile'.

The compiled python code (.pyc) files in the `src/__pycache__' directory will not be deleted. To remove
those files as well, type `make realclean'. If you use `make realclean', you
need not first type `make clean' as it will do it for you. Running `make
realclean' will also remove the `bin' and `src/__pycache__' directories.


IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
Your system must have Python 3.5.1+.
